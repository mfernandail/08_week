## 💻 Mini project of the week:  
**🌐 Dynamic List from a Public API**  
A functional app that performs an HTTP request to an external API (like JSONPlaceholder or PokéAPI), retrieves data, and displays it as dynamic cards on the screen.  
The project includes asynchronous data loading, error management, and clean visual presentation of the fetched information.
